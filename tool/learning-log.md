Things that I have learned today:
- GameObject = containers for components, usually represent characters, props and scenery. (Camera is also a GameObject)
- Component
	- Physic 2D 
		- Rigidbody 2D = add Gravity to the GameObject 
		- Circle Collider 2D = hitbox 
			- You can use offset to move the circle 
			

Things that I have done today:

-By following this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM, I have set up unity on my computer. 
- Robbed the bird that he was using in the video as my sprite (we don't talk about copyrights :D) 
- I added Rigidbody 2D on a GameObject and I was expecting my bird to drop but instead it went up instead. But what really happened is that I added Rigidbody 2D on Camera so its the Camera falling instead of the bird falling which makes it looks like the bird went up. 
- Added Circle Collider 2D to the bird and adjust the circle with offset so it looks right. I also make the circle a little bit smaller since the video 

### 10/27/24:

Context: 
Because I heard people saying that GoDot is better than Unity in class. I decided to do some research and have some discussions with my group members. Below are some summary thoughts of what I have researched: 
* There are many people that prefers GoDot over Unity because GoDot is more friendly for game developers who seek to do it for fun. 
* There are people that said that Unity are more for big companies and GoDot is more for solo developers or small companies.

With a little bit of researches of people's opinion about these two game engine, we decided to try GoDot today to see if GoDot can be a better tool to create our game. 


I decided to follow this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPeycNt29tY&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa) and to see how the starting progress looks for GoDot. In result, I don't see much difference since GoDot also have a lot of pre-made modules already that allows you to do a lot of stuff already without writing a single lines of code. Also, you can't really just play around with unity or Godot without any tutorial or guides to show you how it looks like and how it suppose to work.
