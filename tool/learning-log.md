Things that I have learned today:
- GameObject = containers for components, usually represent characters, props and scenery. (Camera is also a GameObject)
- Component
	- Physic 2D 
		- Rigidbody 2D = add Gravity to the GameObject 
		- Circle Collider 2D = hitbox 
			- You can use offset to move the circle 
			

Things that I have done today:

-By following this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM, I have set up unity on my computer. 
- Robbed the bird that he was using in the video as my sprite (we don't talk about copyrights :D) 
- I added Rigidbody 2D on a GameObject and I was expecting my bird to drop but instead it went up instead. But what really happened is that I added Rigidbody 2D on Camera so its the Camera falling instead of the bird falling which makes it looks like the bird went up. 
- Added Circle Collider 2D to the bird and adjust the circle with offset so it looks right. I also make the circle a little bit smaller since the video
