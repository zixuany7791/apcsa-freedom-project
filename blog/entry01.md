This year, I decided to work with Benjamin and William to create a 2D pixel city-building simulation game. At first we decided to use Unity as it is a very popluar game engine that is being used by big companies to make very famous games such as Among Us, Pokemon Go, Beat Saber and more. However, with most of our class chose to use Godot as their tool and many people online recommending Godot over Unity. We decided to try Godot as well to compare our experiences to see if Godot works better for us. 

Before we try Godot, we tried Unity first. However, as we are looking through youtube to find a tutorial that is more recent, we eventually found this almost 2 years old video [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM) to set up Unity. To create a project in Unity, it requires you to download Visual Studio as an IDE to code in and then you will have to select a template to work in. After you create your project you will get into the workspace. The UI design is kind of chaotic because there is information everywhere but it looks more simple and a bit organized if you understand what each section does. 

Unity UI sections: 
* The bottom is where the Project is. It is where we put , music, script, pictures of a character and more into the game.
* The top left is where the Hierachy is. It is where the GameObjects is.
* Right side is where the Inspector is. It is where it shows specific information of GameObjects, containers for components. It is where you would add components and adjust information of one GameObjects. 
* The center is where the game would look like and when you run your project, it would direct you to the game tab to see how the game runs.
