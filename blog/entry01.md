This year, I decided to work with Benjamin and William to create a 2D pixel city-building simulation game. At first we decided to use Unity as it is a very popluar game engine that is being used by big companies to make very famous games such as Among Us, Pokemon Go, Beat Saber and more. However, with most of our class chose to use Godot as their tool and many people online recommending Godot over Unity. We decided to try Godot as well to compare our experiences to see if Godot works better for us. 

Before we try Godot, we tried Unity first. However, as we are looking through youtube to find a tutorial that is more recent, we eventually found this almost 2 years old video [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM) to set up Unity. To create a project in Unity, it requires you to download Visual Studio as an IDE to code in and then you will have to select a template to work in.
