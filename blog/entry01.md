# Entry 1
##### 11/2/24

This year, I decided to work with Benjamin and William to create a 2D pixel city-building simulation game. At first we decided to use Unity as it is a very popluar game engine that is being used by big companies to make very famous games such as Among Us, Pokemon Go, Beat Saber and more. However, with most of our class chose to use Godot as their tool and many people online recommending Godot over Unity. We decided to try Godot as well to compare our experiences to see if Godot works better for us. 

### Unity

Before we try Godot, we tried Unity first. However, as we are looking through youtube to find a tutorial that is more recent, we eventually found this almost 2 years old video [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM) to set up Unity. To create a project in Unity, it requires you to download Visual Studio as an IDE to code in and then you will have to select a template to work in. After you create your project you will get into the workspace. The UI design is kind of chaotic because there is information everywhere but it looks more simple and a bit organized if you understand what each section does. 

Unity UI sections: 
* The bottom is where the Project is. It is where we put music, script, pictures of a character and more into the game.
* The top left is where the Hierachy is. It is where the GameObjects is.
* Right side is where the Inspector is. It is where it shows specific information of GameObjects, containers for components. It is where you would add components and adjust information of one GameObjects. 
* The center is where the game would look like and when you run your project, it would direct you to the game tab to see how the game runs.

In the Inspector section, there is add component button at the bottom where you can add components that are either pre-made already by unity or it can be the component that you have code with c#. In this case I tried the Rigitbody2D, components that adds gravity to the GameObject, and Circle Collider 2D, components that add hitbox to the GameObject and created a scene where my game character will fall when it runs. 

Overall, the experience in Unity wasn't that bad. However, it is possible that it is because I don't know what to expect coding a game would be like but this experiences gives me a reference on how it would be like so I can compare to Godot. 

### Godot


I followed this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPeycNt29tY&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa) to set up Godot and it is a lot more simpler compared to Unity. I downloaded godot from the official website and when you open godot, you can already start creating a project. 

When you open the project, you will get into the IDE where you will be working on the project. Nothing really changes for UI design except at the bottom left there is a file system where you can organize your files and the bottom is not where you put files into the project but instead it is the console. 

To use the components of the of the GameObjects, rather than looking at the inspector, instead you will need to create a child node of that GameObject. There are a ot of pre-made components in Godot, it is so much that when you are trying to find a specific component, it is like finding a specific html code in a website as you are looking through the code. Thanksfully there is a search bar at the top so if you know the name you can just type it. 


### Conclusion 

Though I haven't really get into much of both Unity and Godot, but considering Godot being a more recent popular game engine with a lot more classmates using it to do their freedom project, it will become easier to work with whenever we need to look for help. Additionally, Godot tutorial are more recent than Unity tutorial therefore we have to worry about less things about the updates as well as the Godot setup being more simpler than Unity setup shows that it will be easier to work with Godot than Unity. In result, we agreed to switch to Godot because the faster we can learn our tool, the more time we have to make our game. 

In the Engineering Design Process, we are currently on stage 1 and 2 which is defining and researching the problem. We had defined what we wanted to do and researched and selected the tools that we will be using for the project. Throughout this time, we have practice communicating with each other as well as decision making. We had lots of discussion on whether or not we should change to Godot from Unity and listed many pros and cons based on the information we had collected.
