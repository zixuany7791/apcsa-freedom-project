# Entry 4

I am currently on stage 5 on Engineering Design Process, which is starting to make our project. 

After we setup the project in the winter break, we started planning how we can create our first building's functionality. We choose to create a construction building where its functionality is to be able to allow player to build buildings in a certain area. So we separate this into different sections, I make the building interactable meanwhile my partner working on creating a menu that will appear when the player interact with the building. 

So, I started by create interaction area for the building so that when the player enters the area, they can choose to interact with it. Afterwards, I created a script that allows the player to interact with the building by pressing e. When the player does that, a menu will popup and the player can select what they can build.

I run the game to see if it works and it works very well. However there is this one issue: when I interact with the building, I can still be able to move and the menu doesn't follow the player so it just stays there. At first I wanted to make it so that the menu does follows the player but then I realize that it probably doesn't make sense that way because you shouldn't be able to have the menu when you leave the building. So instead I decided to make it so that when the player interact with the building, the player will not be able to move until they press the "escape" key to stop the interaction. 

When we are done the result looks like this: 

When the player is away from the building it looks like this:

When the player get closer, a text shows up:

And then when the player press e, this pops out:

The player will not be able to move until they press the escape key. 



Throughout this process, me and my partners have practicing problem decomposition where there are several problems that occurs when we put what we learned into this project. By separating the tasks between my partners, we have speed up our process of creating the functionality of the construction building. We would just need to continue working on this to make it so that when we interact with the construction building, the entire map would appear along with the menu and when the player click on one of the building on the menu, you will be able to click somewhere on the map and the game will start construct the building for you at the position on the map that you placed. Another skill that we practice is communication because we had a little conflict on how player should build buildings. My partner thought that it would be the best by having a button in the player ui and when they click it they can choose the building and place it in an area that the is close to. Meanwhile I think it is the best that we have a building for build buildings and when the player interact with the building, they can see the whole map and they choose what they want to build to where. Eventually, we had an agreement that we would create a construction building considering that it is also a job for people and the players would be able to control people's job better.
