# Entry 6
##### 6/1/25

I am currently on the last stage of Engineering Design Process, which is to present our project to people.

Last year's presentation I got quite a lot of feedbacks saying that people don't actually understand what our presentation is talking about. I believe that the reason why people don't understand what we are talking about is because we focus a lot on our code and doesn't communicate to our audience on what that code actually does visually so it becomes quite confusing. Therefore this year I wanted to talk about a part of our code that are fundamental to our project and the audience are able to understand what it actually does because this code is being used very often, which is the code that allows the plyer to be able to place down buidings. In order for audience to understand what specific part of our code does, I also started to do some recording and converted into gif so the audience know how each section of the code does, visually. 

During the presentation however, I have failed to bring some of the idea out smoothly, I ended up repeating the same thing three times when I am trying to transition from a result of a chunk of code to adding limitations to when the code should be ran. Despite written what I planned to say on the speaker notes, I never actually have practice saying them out loud to someone or myself even. Instead I spend those times continue to work on the project because it wasn't complete. I wanted to add more stuff to make the game looks more presentable such as having more than 2 building so the gameplay becomes more diverse and there are some kind of mechanics that makes the game a little challenging. 

I also used some of the time that I was suppose to work on the elevator pitch into working on the game, ended up having literally no time to rehearse the elevator pitch. We had to decide who to say what during the EXPO instead of before which messed up because none of us are prepared to give the elevator pitch. At the end, I can tell from the judge's eye that they aren't impressed the way I wanted them to be. From that moment on, I am sure that we wouldn't be a finalist. 

We have created a very amazing project but we didn't really tell people how amazing it actually is. We have introduced them our project in a very lame way that makes our project looks bad and I feel very disappointed in myself for that. Throughout this time, I have realized my needs in practice on skills such as communication and time management, I didn't came into EXPO prepared to give a good elevator pitch to show how good our project is and I didn't communicate with my partners about elevator pitch, which ended up the elvator pitch being very messy.
